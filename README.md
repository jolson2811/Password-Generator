# Password-Generator

### The goal for this challenge was to create an application that can generate a random password based on criteria the user selects. When a user clicks the generate password button, they will be given a series of prompts to determine length of password and which character types to use. The user input will be validated and at least one character type must be selected. Once all prompts are answered, the password is generated based on selected criteria and displayed on the page.
